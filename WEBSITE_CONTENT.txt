================================================================================
  NOTES FOR CONTENT UPDATE
================================================================================

1. The website currently uses "Smart School Security System" in SEO meta
   and "Smart School Attendance System" in the hero badge -- these should
   be consistent.

2. The hero description focuses on "attendance tracking" while much of the
   rest of the site emphasizes "security" -- the messaging should be aligned
   to the actual Entraguard project scope.

3. Testimonials use Filipino names (Maria Santos, Principal Garcia, James
   Reyes, Dr. Ana Cruz, Mark Villanueva, Lisa Tan) -- verify if these should
   be real or clearly marked as placeholder.

4. Stats section claims "60+ Partner Schools" -- verify accuracy.

5. Pricing is set at PHP 180.00/month/student -- verify current pricing.

6. Social media links in footer all point to "#" (no actual URLs set).

7. Contact form currently has no backend integration (just resets form
   on submit).

8. The "Powered by RAG IT Solutions" link goes to https://www.ragph.com/
